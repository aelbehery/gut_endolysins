## ðŸ“˜ Repository Overview

This repository contains the commands used to identify and characterize **phage-encoded lytic proteins** â€” specifically **endolysins** and **holins** â€” from a large dataset of uncultured gut phage genomes.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### 1. `commands.txt`
This text file contains all commands used for:
- Identifying endolysin and holin candidates  
- Characterizing these proteins using domain annotation, sequence similarity search, and signal peptide prediction.
- Predicting associated phage host
- Predicting phage life style
